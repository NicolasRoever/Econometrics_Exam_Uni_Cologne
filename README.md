# Econometrics_Exam University of Cologne
This is the code I prepared for the exam in Advanced Econometrics on February 5th
2024 at the University of Cologne with Prof. Breitung.

## Intended Use

The folder is the code to bring to the exam. During the exam, place the data for 
question 1 in the folder data/question1 and the data for question 2 in the folder
data/question2. \\
The scripts main_question1_exam_2024.R and main_question2_exam_2024.R are the place
to solve the questions. The scripts load all packages required in last years exam
and automatically load the data. \\
Then, you should be ready to solve the questions :). 

## Contents

1. main_question1_exam_2024.R/main_question2_exam_2024.R: The scripts are where 
I intend to solve the questions

2. functions_exam_2024.R: The script contains all functions I used when solving the 
previous exams - feel free to use them or delete them if they confuse you

3. Exam_2023a/Exam_2023b: These folders includes my solutions to last years exam. 
These are my solutions and I do not gurarantee that they are correct! Let me
know if you find any mistakes. The folders follows the same file structure I set up 
for this years exam.
